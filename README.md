## Observations

ยน Using Lombok and Mapstruct together will produce the error <i>Could not retrieve @Mapper annotation during compilation</i> to prevent that you need to set the path of mapstruct to contain lombok. See [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/faq/#Can-I-use-MapStruct-together-with-Project-Lombok) for more infomation.
